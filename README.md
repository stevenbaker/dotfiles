# stevenbaker's dotfiles
=========

## Introduction 

_Common problem: When the commandline is your home, SSH'ing into a new box feels like moving into an empty apartment._

Solution: This repo.  It's my way to quickly and easily get my current shell environment to something that feels familiar, across a variety of setups:

* Local Mac OS machine
* Remote Linux instances
* Vagrant boxes

## Installation

### Using Git + install script

You can clone the repository where you want.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenbaker/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
```

To copy the repo's dotfiles into your home directory, run the boostrap script:
```bash
source install.sh
```

Note that this will overwrite any existing files of the same name that you have in your home directory.  Because of this, a confirmation prompt is shown.

You can avoid the confirmation prompt:
```bash
set -- -f; source install.sh
```

### Git-free install

The following command will install the dotfiles directly to your home directory without using Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/stevenbaker/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,install.sh,LICENSE}
```
